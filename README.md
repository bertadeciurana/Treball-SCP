This TFG talks about the neuronal networks. Neuronal networks per se provide an ability to process information. Given the complexity of neurological processes nowadays science is not able to completely understand how the information travels inside the brain. However, they do know many facts about neurons, synapses and action potentials (AP).


Those artificial neural networks, which are widely used in machine learning, are mostly based on a feedforward architecture. However, natural neuronal networks are characterized by abundant recurrent connections. This feedback provides recurrent neuronal networks with fading memory, this enables them to process time-dependent information. [1]


With this TFG, Miguel Ángel aimed to study how memory mechanisms emerge in a natural neuronal network such as the one from C. elegans, and he tried to determine how long-term memory is established within the recurrent computation paradigm.
